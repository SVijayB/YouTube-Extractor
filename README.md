## Motivation

We all have tried downloading a YouTube video atleast once in our lives. Be it a song or a video for your school/college assignment. <br>
True, there are plenty of browser extensions and online websites avilable to download YouTube videos. But, at times either the extension malfunctions or the servers don't work anymore. 

And hence YouTube-Extractor was made. You can launch it any time and download any video/audio on YouTube.

## Installation

For the latest stable version, head to [Releases](https://github.com/SVijayB/YouTube-Extractor/releases)

Download and extract the source code.

As an alternative, you could also clone the repository using,

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/SVijayB/YouTube-Extractor.git
</pre>

Before running the YouTube-Extractor, make sure you have pytube3 installed. To do this, type the following code in your terminal.

<pre>
python -m pip install pytube3==10.4.1
</pre>

As an alternative you can also cd to YouTube-Extractor directory and type 

<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

To check if pytube3 is successfully installed on your computer, open your terminal and type `pytube3 --version`
Once you have pytube3 installed, just run the `YouTube Extractor.py` file present in the `src` folder.

**Note** : Typing-Speed-Test uses custom fonts. Most windows computers have them preinstalled. However, if you don't have them already, just open the `Fonts` folder present in assets and launch all the files present and hit on install.

## Usage

Once you have the fonts and pytube3 installed. Just open the src folder and launch the `Youtube Extractor.py` file. 

**Note** : In order to download an entire playlist at once, just copy the first video from the playlist -> index = 1, and select the playlist checkbox.
